* emacsconf-update
** Installation

You can download [[emacsconf-update.el]] and put it somewhere in your load-path.

If you use quelpa, you can put this in your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(emacsconf-update :fetcher url :url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacsconf/emacsconf-el/main/emacsconf-update.el"))
#+end_src

** Usage
These functions might make it easier for you to keep an Org file with
your own notes while letting you download schedule updates or title changes.

Make a file for your notes with Org, and then call
=M-x emacsconf-update-org-from-ical-url= . It should load the talks and
tentative schedules from the wiki. You can call it again and it should
update the titles and schedules while still keeping whatever notes
you've added.

You may also like =M-x emacsconf-update-view-org-agenda=.

I don't know if it works for anyone but me, but it might be worth a
try. =)
